 ## For ... in ... loops
 So from our last page, we have a *string* (that's programmer speak for "a piece of text").
 
 The string is composed of 1's and 0's.
 
 Below, a special type of loop is used.
 
 Run this playground several times.
 
 What do you notice about how this loop operates?
 
 What is *different* compared to our usual *for i in stride(...* type of loop?
 
 What is the *same*?
 
 Be specific.
 
 Type your answer in the code comment.

// Loop
for character in encodedBitmap {
    print(character)
}

// I notice that not only does the sequnce and amount of '0's and '1's change, but the amount of times looped changes, never going more than 20 times.
// The loop is for character in
